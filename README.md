# Open Budget - Personal Budget Management App

A comprehensive Ruby on Rails application to manage budgets, income events, expenses, shopping lists, and home inventory with PostgreSQL as the database. It allows you to create budget periods (monthly, quarterly, custom), plan expenses for each income payment, track expenses by category, manage shopping lists with budget integration, track household inventory, and view dynamic pace calculations to monitor spending.

## Features

### Budget Management
- **Budget Periods**: Create and manage budget periods with start/end dates and total planned amount.
- **Budget Line Items**: Break down a budget period into categories with planned amounts.
- **Categories**: Define categories like Food, Transport, Utilities, etc.
- **Expenses**: Log expenses with date, amount, description, and category. Link expenses to budget periods.
- **Dynamic Pace**: On each budget period's page, view:
  - Amount you should have spent to date (pro rata).
  - Actual amount spent.
  - Remaining budget.

### Income & Expense Planning
- **Income Events**: Track expected and received income payments with dates and amounts.
- **Planned Expenses**: Plan how to allocate each income payment across different expense categories before the money arrives.
- **Expense Templates**: Create recurring expense templates for long-term savings goals (e.g., vacation fund, emergency fund).
- **Previous Balance Tracking**: Automatically track how negative balances from previous income events impact the current event's available budget, providing better visibility into financial flow.

#### Planned Expenses vs. Actual Expenses

The application uses two separate models to distinguish between **planned spending** and **actual spending**:

**Planned Expenses (`PlannedExpense`)**
- Represent your **intended spending** before money is actually spent
- Created when you plan how to allocate an income event
- Have a `status` field (e.g., "pending_to_pay", "saved", "spent", "paid", "transferred")
- Automatically create an `Expense` record when status is set to "spent", "paid", or "transferred"
- Can be manually applied using the "Apply" button to create an expense record

**Actual Expenses (`Expense`)**
- Represent **actual money spent** (real transactions)
- Can be created in two ways:
  1. **From Planned Expenses**: Automatically created when a planned expense status changes to "spent"/"paid"/"transferred", or manually via the "Apply" button
  2. **Direct Expenses**: Created directly and assigned to an income event (for unplanned spending)

**Key Relationships:**
- A `PlannedExpense` can have one `Expense` (via `planned_expense_id`)
- An `Expense` can belong to an `IncomeEvent` directly (for unplanned spending) or through a `PlannedExpense`
- Both planned expenses and direct expenses are counted in the income event's "Total Planned" calculation
- Only actual expenses are counted in "Total Spent"

**Automatic Expense Creation:**
- When you create a planned expense with status "spent", "paid", or "transferred", an expense record is automatically created
- When you update a planned expense status to "spent", "paid", or "transferred", an expense record is automatically created
- The "Apply" button appears for any planned expense that doesn't have an expense record yet, allowing you to manually create it

**Handling Legacy Data:**
- If you have planned expenses with status "spent" but no expense record (from before automatic creation was implemented), the "Apply" button will be visible
- Click "Apply" to manually create the missing expense record

#### Previous Balance Feature

The Previous Balance feature provides visibility into how financial deficits carry forward between income events:

- **Automatic Calculation**: Each income event automatically calculates the previous balance from the immediately preceding income event in the same budget period.
- **Effective Date Ordering**: Events are ordered by `received_date` (if received) or `expected_date` (if pending), ensuring chronological accuracy.
- **Cumulative Carryover**: Negative balances from previous events reduce the effective available budget for the current event, creating a cumulative chain of financial impact.
- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - Red borders and warning icons highlight income events with negative previous balances
  - Clear breakdown shows: `Income Amount - Previous Balance - Planned = Effective Remaining`
  - Color-coded displays (red for negative, green for positive)

**Example**: If your January 15th income had a -$500 deficit and your February 1st income is $2000, the effective remaining budget after planning expenses will be reduced by $500, giving you a true picture of available funds.

### Shopping List & Inventory Management
- **Shopping List**: Track items you need to buy with optional links to planned expenses and categories.
  - Quick add items (name required only, all other fields optional)
  - Mark items as purchased
  - Support for one-time and recurring purchases
  - Filter by status (pending/purchased)
  - Convert shopping items to planned expenses or actual expenses
  - Link shopping items to existing planned expenses
  - Estimated amounts help plan your budget before spending
- **Home Inventory**: Track household items with stock level awareness.
  - Track stock states: in stock, low, or empty
  - Visual indicators (colored circles) for quick status recognition
  - One-click "Add to Shopping List" for low or empty items
  - Categorize items and mark as consumable/non-consumable
  - Filter inventory by stock state
  - Checklist-style interface for easy scanning

**Integration with Budget System:**
- Shopping items can be converted to `PlannedExpense` to plan spending before money arrives
- Shopping items can be converted to `Expense` to record actual spending
- Shopping items can be linked to existing planned expenses
- Estimated amounts from shopping items contribute to budget planning
- Inventory items automatically create shopping items when stock is low or empty

### User Interface
- **Responsive UI**: Browse expenses in table or card grid layouts with Tailwind CSS.
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded displays for negative balances, warnings, and status indicators.
- **Filtering & Searching**: Filter expenses by date range, category, and description text.

## Testing

The application uses Minitest for testing. Comprehensive regression tests ensure the previous balance calculation works correctly across various edge cases.

Run all tests:
```bash
rails test
```

Run specific test files:
```bash
rails test test/models/income_event_test.rb
```

### Test Coverage

The `IncomeEvent` model includes comprehensive tests for:
- Previous balance calculation with events on the same date
- Handling of received vs expected dates for ordering
- Budget period isolation
- Cumulative balance carryover chains
- Year boundary handling
- Negative balance impact calculations

See `test/models/income_event_test.rb` for full test coverage.
